    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "The words “Diversity and Inclusion” often provoke animosity and disparity in the workplace. Phrases and labels that are meant to be positive and describe people and workplace issues often have the opposite affect and instead produce division and isolation. But how do we resolve disparity in the workplace and have productive conversations? How do we correct our approach and stop alienating each other? We seek open and productive dialog involving often competing viewpoints, yet sensitive topics are met with kid gloves when they require compassion and balance. We must replace the apathy of tolerance with the empathy of understanding. We need to learn how to navigate difficult conversations, avoid their divisive triggers, and restore collaboration and unity. Attend this session to better understand the multi-facets of highly effective communication. Learn the 5 steps to having a difficult conversation and how these conversations can help you manage and work within diverse teams. We will also discuss how to incorporate unity, collaboration, and mentorship into your work.",

A hard skill for a carpenter, for example, might be the ability to operate a power saw or use framing squares.",

Not only can Docker-izing your development environment solve that issue, but it can make it drop-dead simple to onboard new developers, keep a team working forward and allow everyone on the team use their desired tools! \r\nI will show you how to get Docker set up to use as the run environment for your software projects, how to maintain the docker environment, and even how easy it will be to deploy the whole environment to production in a way that you are actually developing in an environment that isn’t just “like” production. It IS the production environment!\r\nYou will learn the basics of Docker, how to use it to develop and how to deploy your “development” environment as the production environment!",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&apos;ll be wearing branded t-shirts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "<p>This session is about your career perspective as an engineer, especially when the path may take an &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; turn from technical lead to first-time engineering manager. We will explore the differences between managing and leading, review different management styles, and discuss their impact on both the manager and the team member. Finally, we will find out why you do not want to treat everyone equally. I will share my personal experiences going from being one of the team to actually managing it: the pitfalls of suddenly being responsible for the team, typical problems surfacing, and how to avoid common mistakes. As part of the session, I would also like to share thoughts and considerations about which career path could be the right one for whom, and what the advantages and disadvantages are going one way or the other. This is not a &ldquo;You get it all from the expert&rdquo;- session, but a session to share experiences and discuss how this fits to your career path.</p>",

Soft skills are different from hard skills, which are directly relevant to the job you are applying for. These are often more quantifiable, and easier to learn. A hard skill for a carpenter, for example, might be the ability to operate a power saw or use framing squares.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "<p>Functional programming (FP) is a hot topic these days. Often times getting started with FP is a series of tutorials that show the learner how to use functions like map, filter, and reduce (fold in some languages). Maybe the learner will start to stumble on words like functor and monad. These are all really good things but does not show how to apply functional programming in a larger programming context. How does functional programming help developers solve problems? What does it look like to leverage functional thinking and design in application development? These are something we are going to explore in this section. The primary audience for the session are people who have a curiosity for FP, or have tried their hand at FP only to find themselves stuck on map, filter, and reduce (fold) and want to try to expand their mind further into functional thinking. My goal is to show how to apply FP to day to day programming tasks and help demystify some of the art of FP.</p>",

With ARM, you can create a Template for your environment and use that for deploying identical environments every time without fail! There is some news in the world of “infrastructure as code” that we need to consider while setting up our Cloud environments. The Win we get from being able to deploy our development environment or our temporary load test environment automatically and identically to our production environment cannot be understated. This is ARM from a project efficiency, development and DevOps perspective. This is what you need to know to make you much more efficient every day of development.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "In today&#39;s job market being an effective communicator is a critical skill even if you are a developer who just wants to write code all day.   Being a confident communicator and public speaker can set you apart from the crowd.  Public speaking  at the end of the day is all about effectively communicating our ideas to others.  We have all been training our whole lives to be better communicators.  Not a one of us was born with the ability to talk.  Talking is a learn skill,  just like public speaking is.  Anyone can learn to be a confident communicator with a bit of know-how and some practice.\r\n\r\nI will share with you how I went from a shy, introverted software developer who would run away from any kind of public speaking to a professional speaker that sprints towards every speaking opportunity and how you can  do it as well. \r\n\r\nYou will walk away on the road to becoming a confident public speaker that knows how to give an effective presentation and will be ready to nail your next presentation.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Blazor promises that we can create web applications using the backend languages of our choice while compiling to Web Assembly. The current state of UI development is complex and the problem is not getting better. Many developers are curious about Blazor, while some are skeptical. What problems might Blazor solve?</p>\r\n<p>This session is ideal for developers and other interested parties who have little or no knowledge of Blazor and want to learn the basics. It will provide a brief overview of Blazor and then it will show a simple but practical implementation of Blazor. It will utilize Visual Studio 2017 and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, starting with a small Azure SQL database and Web API, and then building a Blazor web application that interacts with these components. Links to relevant information and tutorials will be provided.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Learn to set up your environment for testing and code coverage.  We&#39;ll also look at list compression, mocking objects, dynamic module loading.  \r\n\r\nA bot can help automated many tasks and is fun! Many organizations use chat bots to automate certain tasks including getting information quickly and even releasing builds or making system wide changes. This new way of working is often referred to as ChatOps. In addition to company specific tasks, bots are used to also inject fun into the workplace by providing cat gifs or jokes as needed. I&#39;ll share how code camp uses it&#39;s bot ccbot to help us plan the event!\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll look at how you can store secrets in environment variables, as well as easily deploy this bot to an ec2 instance.",

Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

But creating these products outside of well researched spaces is not clear. It&rsquo;s easy in these spaces, for ML practitioners to work hard building incredibly accurate models only to release them in production and find out that nobody likes using the final product using their algorithm because their model wasn&rsquo;t designed for the user. In this session, we&rsquo;ll use a case study to discuss the problems and pitfalls how to iteratively build AI products with an aggressive focus on end user usability. Attendees will leave understanding strategies in road-mapping, simulation, and validation that will help bring the voice of their product to their AI/ML product development cycle.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

Reactive programming models can help to solve these challenges. Additionally RxJs considers the impact of time on these observables which facilitate simplifying gesture based recognition. With RxJs bundled into Angular, you&#39;ll see how you can use it to simplify traditional event-based programming models.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

This first session creates the foundation for the 2nd Clean Code presentation on The Art of Decoupling, as it explains expected base knowledge. Why writing Clean Code makes us more efficient Over the lifetime of a product, maintaining the product is actually one - if not the most - expensive area(s) of the overall product costs. Writing clean code can significantly lower these costs. However, writing clean code also makes you more efficient during the initial development time and results in more stable code. You will be presented design patterns and best practices which will make you write better and more easily maintainable code, seeing the code in a holistic way. You will learn how to apply them by using an existing implementation as the starting point of the presentation. Finally, patterns &amp; practices benefits are explained. This presentation is based on C# and Visual Studio 2017. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.</p>",

    "Abstract": "<p>Why writing Clean Code makes us more efficient? Over the lifetime of a product, maintaining the product is actually one - if not the most - expensive area(s) of the overall product costs. We will dive into why decoupling is so crucial and what design patterns, best practices, and technologies are out there to do it right and want can go wrong. We start by reviewing the basics of Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) and different ways of achieving decoupling on class-level, using and exploring both: Best Practices, Design and Anti Patterns. Then we will move into Microservices, how these push decoupling to the next level and how to combine the different patterns for an extensible, supportable and maintainable code base. This presentation requires knowledge and understanding of basics like DRY, SoC, SRP, SOLID etc. which are building the base for decoupled architecture. However, we will start at the basics of DI and will work towards intermediate scenarios for DI and Microservices depending on the participating group. This presentation is based on C# and Visual Studio 2017. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.</p>",

As a BONUS, the experience you’ll see is an A.I. Perceptron (Google it). You put on the VR headset, place points on a graph, and the Perceptron finds its decision boundary.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "<p>A short two years ago, I talked about <em>\"Bots, Amazon Echo, language user interfaces in general\"</em> the slides are still available and the code is of course still in GitHub. However, much has changed and fortunately for the better!</p>\r\n<p>I still belief that Java is a very suitable language to build <strong>Alexa Skills</strong> and even if you are eventually going to host your skill in EC2 or as an AWS Lambda function, during development, <strong>Tomcat</strong> is your friend. Running and debugging your skill right on your laptop offers tremendous advantages during the development process. So lets talk about how to develop an Alexa Skill using Java and the latest Alexa Skill Kit for Java. We wil be using Java/Tomcat installed on a Laptop as our hosting platform, quickly put an SLL Cert in place, and develop an Alexa Skill.</p>\r\n<p><em>... from WAR to Lambda ...</em></p>\r\n<p>Java sometimes doesn't seem to be a 1st class citizen when it comes to <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>, but with just a few considerations, it's easy to implement an efficient AWS Lambda function in <strong>Java</strong>. To become useful, we'll also put the Lambda function behind the AWS API Gateway, so that it can be called from the web (i.e. with an HTTP GET or POST request).</p>\r\n<p>Once we have done that we'll push the code into a Github Repository and move the build and deployment process into <strong>AWS CodeBuild</strong>. This (still new) AWS service for <strong>Continuous Integration and Deployment</strong> (aka CI/CD) will pull the code from the Git Repo and build the artifact, puts it into an S3 bucket, from which it is deployed into AWS Lambda ... <br /><br />Come on .. that's cool stuff: Software Development meets Dev Ops.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Although math is inherent in how deep learning works, Joe will explain enough to where you don&#39;t have to be an expert in calculus, linear algebra, or statistics. You&#39;ll see that this technology doesn&#39;t require a Ph.D. for any developer who wants to learn and take advantage of AI. By the end of the presentation, you will have seen a full example of how deep learning works, design and considerations, and practical applications.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Canary deployments give your organization early detection systems for errors and data on how your system is used. How can a team move from a different deployment pattern into a pattern that allows your organization to test your customer’s reaction to different software? Eric walks through a real world implementation of this scenario using VSTS, .Net, node.js technologies.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "<p>Amazon DynamoDB is a (popular) nonrelational database (NoSQL) that delivers reliable performance at any scale. It's a fully managed on AWS, multi-region, multi-master database that provides consistent single-digit millisecond latency, and offers built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching.</p>\r\n<p>To use DynamoDB effectively, one must understand key concepts like partition/hash keys or range/sort keys to store NoSQL data, scan vs query calls to access data, projections and expressions, a mapper class for ORM, global secondary indexing to allow adhoc querying, asynchronous calls and batch read/write operations.</p>\r\n<p>As a cloud offering, Dynamo DB needs resource provisioning, time to live and autoscale configuration aligned with your application's needs along with monitoring via Cloudwatch or 3rd party tools. In addition, Dynamo DB also provides in memory acceleration caching via DAX, trigger mechanism and data exports via data pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>This session will cover how to effectively program for DynamoDB noSQL through judicious choice of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Table data's primary keys, secondary indices, schema</li>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In-memory caching (DAX), ORM Mapper class</li>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Effective and efficient ways of querying, scanning (Query expression, projections)</li>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Provisioning, scaling and monitoring (Cloudwatch, autoscale)</li>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Backups, exports, data pipeline for offline/realtime analytics</li>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Cost implications &amp; comparison (Using 2018 AWS $ rates in popular AWS region)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Examples will be provided in Java, Javascript/NodeJS and will walk through the AWS DynamoDB SDK and console with examples for table creation, CRUD operations, capacity management, accelerator cache cluster config and security group settings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<pre>Keywords: Cloud, NoSQL, Dynamo, AWS, DAX, Amazon, Web Services, Storage, Database, DynamoDB&nbsp;</pre>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Sure, tooling has come a long way, but successful mobile apps need a lot more. \r\n\r\nThe whole Xamarin technology stack needs deep understanding. Do you know what platforms you can target &amp; how to maximize code reuse? Let’s do a run-down of the essential tools, frameworks and utilities that should be in every Xamarin developer’s arsenal. The ubiquitous IDEs, necessary plugins, cloud backends, deployment tools, testing solutions, network utilities, DevOps workflows and polished UI – all ready for your app development pleasure. How about adding some cloud-powered AI or Alexa voice assistance to your app? What can you do to delight your users, maintain developer sanity and deliver high quality apps? Let’s stop reinventing wheel and ship apps faster – the right tools help!",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "As our systems increasingly demand more real-time updates, we need better ways of working with these live streams of information. Traditional pull models fail to provide the real-time responsiveness and scale needs that modern systems expect. Moving to a push model allows us to scale easier and react to new data as it becomes available. SignalR facilitates push notifications over HTTP to a variety of clients. The Reactive Extensions were designed to allow for asynchronous LINQ over push based collections. In this talk, you’ll see how the synergy of these two technologies merge to make otherwise difficult tasks, a push over.",

    "Name": "Getting Started in React",
    "Abstract": "<p>One of the reasons for React's huge popularity in building Web Applications is that it's a pretty big paradigm shift from previous techniques of JavaScript in the front-end. The shift in the way we think about how front-end apps should be built is very powerful and makes App creation much easier than in the past. However, getting used to the new paradigm can be a bit of a struggle at first. This talk will assume your JS chops are decent and that you might be coming from another library or framework like jQuery or Angular. I'll teach the basics of React including the parts that often go unexplained.</p>\r\n<p>Pro Tip: One frequent comment from people trying to learn React is how they it's difficult because most React tutorials are very ES6+ heavy and it's hard to tell what is a React thing and what is just the new ES6 and beyond stuff. Well, the React community embraces the modern JavaScript ES6 syntax so it's worth becoming familair with before learning React, so be sure to brush up on some of these things:</p>\r\n<p>- Object Destructuring (including parameter destructuring) <br />- The new \"spread\" operator - Arrow Functions (http://bradwestfall.com/articles/dont-get-javascript-es6-arrow-functions)<br />- The new JS Class Syntax (Btw, JS Classes are purposely not meant to be as full-featured as traditional OOP langs)<br />- And \"JavaScript Promises\"</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "Git is such an essential skill in today&#39;s development ecosystem that I would argue that being familiar with it is as important as knowing how to code itself especially considering that you will most likely ended up working in groups and git being the superior code sharing tool these days.\r\n\r\nWhile a lot of people uses git platforms (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket) to host their personal projects, there is still quite a gap between keeping track of your own project and working collaboratively with someone else. In a personal setting, you can always commit to master and keep everything in that one branch. While it is not ideal, that&#39;s what works for most people. \r\n\r\nInstead, the session will be focusing on the effective use of forking, branching, creating issues, creating PRs, issue ticket referencing etc.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

In this session we&#39;ll introduce you to the capabilities of the compiler platform and demonstrate how we can extend it to more proactively catch common coding smells and patterns that would have otherwise caused runtime exceptions that can be caught during compilation instead. If you&#39;ve relied on third party commercial coding tools like resharper in the past, you&#39;ll see how you can build your own tooling extensions or leverage some of the many open source solutions.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "<p>This isn't a session about a vanity architecture nor about how about all other architecture styles are wrong. This session digs into what is right about various architectural styles and how parts of different styles are really the same thing. After a quick review of what software architecture is, the principles, values, and effective mission of the various components of each style will be clarified to reveal&nbsp;<em>Integrated Architecture</em>. What that means for .NET Visual Studio solution and project structure and design will be covered as a means of solidifying the concepts. Depending on audience preference, styles like Service-orientation, Service-Oriented Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture, n-Tier and Layered architecture, Message-Driven/Event-Oriented, GRASP, etc. can be used for comparison and contrast.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI. I am a public speaker and present internationally on a lot of different technology topics, a list of them are available at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/\">https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/</a>. &nbsp;I have been recognized as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jjg.me/MVPLink\">Microsoft MVP</a>&nbsp;in .NET (since 2009) and a Friends of Red Gate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.red-gate.com/community/friends-of-rg\">program</a>(since 2015).</p>\r\n<h3>Some of my notable achievements</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Former President and Vice President of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ineta.org/\">INETA</a>&nbsp;North America (2007-2015)</li>\r\n<li>Founder of the Southeast Valley .NET User Group (<a href=\"https://sevdnug.org/home.aspx\">SEVDNUG</a>) in Chandler, AZ (2007-2013)</li>\r\n<li>Currently serving on my the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/\">City of Chandler</a>'s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=287\">Parks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=732\">Recreation</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=268\">board</a>&nbsp;(since 2010)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/community/client-profile.aspx?cId=187651\">Telerik MVP</a>&nbsp;(2010 to 2012)</li>\r\n<li>Microsoft Visual Basic MVP (1996)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Open Source Projects (<a href=\"https://www.github.com/jguadagno\">https://www.github.com/jguadagno</a>)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bingsharp.codeplex.com/\">BingSharp</a>: A wrapper around the Bing API in C#</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jguadagno/bootstrapThemeSwitcher\">bootstrapThemeSwitcher</a>: jquery plugin to dynamically load Bootstrap themes</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jguadagno/twbs-flickrCarousel\">twbs-flickrCarousel</a>: a bootstrap carousel to loop through Flickr pictures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Events I organize or participate in</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://desertcodecamp.com/\">Desert Code Camp</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://azgivecamp.org/\">AZGiveCamp</a></li>\r\n<li>Organizer for the 1st Time MVP event at the MVP Summit</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.josephguadagno.net/page/MVP-Summit-2011-C-MVP-2-MVP-Sessions.aspx\">MVP 2 MVP Sessions</a>&nbsp;at MVP Summit.</li>\r\n<li>Awesome bean pusher at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://geekgive.org/project/mvpsummit2012.aspx\">GeekGive</a>&nbsp;at the MVP Summit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Resume</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.josephguadagno.net/Resume/\">/resume/</a></p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "<p>Rust is a modern, strongly-typed, non-garbage collected language from Mozilla pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed. For three years the StackOverflow survey has placed Rust as the most loved language. You can write anything from operating systems, device drivers, video games, graphical applications, to web applications in Rust. It can be a little intimidating to get started as there are a few concepts that may be new to the learner. We'll explore the language by looking at how to build a program that queries and aggregates data from a web service, breaking it down for beginners and seasoned Rustaceans alike. After this session, you should be able to understand some of the features of Rust, how to get started, and where to find resources to continue learning Rust if you so desire.</p>",

    "Abstract": "Java version 8/1.8 has become the industry standard and enables developers to use Lambda expressions, Stream API, functional interfaces due to their popularity, performance improvements etc.,<br />\r\n1. Java lambda expressions are Java's first step into functional programming. A Java lambda expression is thus a function which can be created without belonging to any class and can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.<br />\r\n2. Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.<br />\r\n3. A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit.<br />\r\nThe question is as a developer are we following good practices in applying these powerful features to our code? Following good practices will help in writing maintainable and easily understandable code, increases efficiency and reduces cost. In this session, I'll share some good practices for using Java 8/1.8 features.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

Come see how Kubernetes (K8s) adds a mature solution for running containers in production and development. We&#39;ll start with Docker containers and Docker compose files, and we&#39;ll layer in pods, deployments, services, and ingress. We&#39;ll dig into minikube and kubernetes in docker desktop for local work, and managed cloud K8s on Azure. You&#39;ll leave with a solid understanding of the principles of K8s, and a practical set of skills for driving this container orchestrator throughout the software development lifecycle.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

However, Go’s unconventional approach to multi-threaded programming leads to a steep initial learning curve.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve learned that this barrier in understanding can be broken through visual abstractions. I’ll be introducing Go’s concurrency primitives through illustrations and examples to make these concepts click for future learning and development. \r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll leave with a solid understanding of the purpose and application of these tools, and will be ready to start making your first concurrent programs in Go.\r\n\r\nA smaller, written example of this talk can be found here: https://medium.com/@trevor4e/learning-gos-concurrency-through-illustrations-8c4aff603b3",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#.

    "Name": "Leveraging Go to Build a FaaS Platform",
    "Abstract": "<p>This will be a step-by-step talk on building a FaaS platform for executing Go functions from packages exposed via Git and a REST API to trigger function execution. The system will utilize the Go build system internally, text templates, GOPATH, and the Go standard library atop FreeBSD Jails and ZFS. Function as a service (FaaS) is a type of cloud computing that allows a consumer of the service the ability to run discrete, specific pieces of code rather than building a full application or integrating that functionality into a larger application. This approach allows for potentially less code, cheaper computing costs, and faster development. These systems are quickly becoming integral components of modern architectures. Most of the major cloud providers have incorporated some form of FaaS into their service offering. One of the biggest benefits to using one of these services is that you have access to the catalog of other services they offer which allows for building powerful applications quickly with less code. This talk will go through the steps necessary to build your own FaaS system that will be able to execute Go functions in packages accessible via Git. We&rsquo;ll begin with a high level review of what FreeBSD Jails are, how they&rsquo;re used traditionally and how they&rsquo;ll be used by our system. Then a high level review of ZFS, more from the perspective of our use case which will include zpools, datasets, snapshots, and clones and how they&rsquo;ll provide us with our filesystems. Once the base system components are understood, we&rsquo;ll take a look at why Go is a great choice to build this system. At the heart of what binds these components together is Go&rsquo;s text template system, the compiler, GOPATH, and the standard library. The talk will also cover building an extremely simple DHCP server embedded into the application as well as a REST API for triggering function execution and a means of administration. The goal, By the end is to have the audience understand how Go makes building a FaaS platform easy with real world, practical examples, and a reference implementation to use for inspiration or to build from.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

From Bootstrap to YUI to a sea of commercial control suites, you are fed beautiful code samples on \"How\", but when your needs extend beyond the out-of-box experience, you are alone, left with elegant buttons on an inelegant website. You get Frankenstein's Monster. But what if there was something better? Something not built upon &ldquo;How&rdquo;; something built upon &ldquo;Why&rdquo;. From the makers of Angular, we bring you Material, a full design specification to help you understand the reason instead of just the implementation. Like a requirements document for padding and line-height and margin. For many a software developer, CSS is a scary place. Let this be your guide.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

In this session we'll discuss challenges faced when using Selenium and demonstrate how Cypress can help with those challenges. At the end of the demo attendees will have an understanding of what Cypress is and isn't, marvel at the simple installation process, see how to write a test using Javascript without inspecting elements in the page source, know how to mock a response from API calls and learn some of the best practices that can help you be more successful at testing using Cypress.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#.

    "Abstract": "There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors. \r\n\r\nThis session is about naming things. In software, we need to name classes, methods, properties, libraries, and solutions.  We also have to give names to variables, parameters, namespaces, interfaces, services, resources, etc.  And most of the time, they can&#39;t conflict.  Sometimes it&#39;s easy but sometimes it can be hard. \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll do a quick review of some of the easy guidelines that avoid some (somewhat easy) decisions then look into the things that require names that involve a deeper understanding of context.  What the contexts are, their granularity, and how that applies to alleviating naming issues will be covered.  How the types of contexts and their motivation and good compartmentalization makes for easier naming will be detailed. We&#39;ll dig into some details of English grammar that should relegate naming is hard as a code smell—something that hints at deeper problems in the structure of code. And finally, time permitting, some techniques and ideas to relegate *naming is hard* to problems of the past will be outlined.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers.

All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "Abstract": "<p>Implemented in pure Java, the open source vlingo/platform makes using contemporary DDD tools, as well as the surrounding cloud and microservices architectures and patterns, vastly simpler to deliver successfully by means of a modern reactive toolset. The vlingo/platform supports the ways that a DDD Bounded Context and its Ubiquitous Language are contemporarily modeled and expressed. Underlying everything in the vlingo/platform is the vlingo/actors toolkit, which is an implementation of the Actor Model, making message-driven and event-driven microservices fully concurrent. Other platform tools include reactive clustering, actor partitioning/sharding, HTTP, authentication and authorization, service registration and discovery, persistence, event sourcing, and streams.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "Abstract": "<p>Using the foundational ideas of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), including the Bounded Context, Ubiquitous Language, Context Mapping, and business-driven modeling, this talk explores modeling uncertainty. Systems today are far more likely to be distributed, especially due to the ever increasing popularity of the cloud and microservices. Systems are also increasingly asynchronous, event-driven, and reactive. In the face of these and other influencing conditions, a pertinent question is, how can DDD be even more relevant today than when it was first explained? This talk addresses the current industry competing forces, and how the uncertainty introduced by vastly distributed systems can be finessed into highly functioning, business-centric systems, that teams can design, develop, and reason about.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "Abstract": "Testing React applications has followed a fairly standard pattern for a while now: set up enzyme, shallow render a component, and assert against various aspects of said component. Finally, if you were enough of a glutton for punishment, you&#39;d set up some Selenium tests for end-to-end testing. However, some new tools have come onto the scene recently that have changed how I and others think about testing our applications. \r\n\r\nWhat we&#39;ll cover in this session\r\n\r\n- Why shallow rendering is still ok, let&#39;s just think about why we&#39;re using it\r\n- Thinking about tests from the users&#39; perspective with react-testing-library\r\n- Testing with RTL when using react-router\r\n- Using Cypress.io for simple e2e testing\r\n- What to mock/stub in my e2e tests",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "Abstract": "<p>Deep learning systems are being used to manipulate public perception to create stampedes of fear and hate. They are listening, watching, and experimenting on us; probing us and measuring our reactions to learn what pushes our buttons. This talk is about how they work, and how we can fight back.</p>\r\n<div>Social media is pervasive and intensely scrutinized by deep learning systems. It started as a way to gather \"eyeballs\", to sell ad space. But nobody paid enough attention for branding campaigns to be very effective, let alone product information spots. Despite the inability for traditional advertising to \"stick\", deep learning and individual targeting showed that social media is surprisingly effective at herding people to buy trendy things. While this ability to influence crowd behavior has been useful in commerce, a new and far more lucrative application is taking over: Changing the course of nations. And nothing influences group behavior so cost efficiently as fostering petty emotions like fear and hate. Robert's talk will explore the theory, recent applications, and potential destinations of this shift. Then he will present some of the countermeasures for immediate personal defense and longer-term solutions for protecting our society and the ability to think freely.</div>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

A hard skill for a carpenter, for example, might be the ability to operate a power saw or use framing squares.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#.

Having a concise unit test case suite basically forms foundation to a solid build pipeline implementation where we can setup thresholds. TDD is now completely into mainstream development focusing the age old methodology of test cases being the driver of the development to provide unambiguous requirements and reduction in defects early on in development. We will have discussion around different testing strategies and will use Java for demonstrating Unit testing with help of JUnit and Spring Boot.",

Actually the Actor Model is almost as old as the formal definition of object-oriented programming, and addresses the long-term direction of computing and software development. This talk explains why actors are so vital to the future of software development, and why actors are so exceptionally well suited for use with Domain-Driven Design. Find out how actors speak the Ubiquitous Language of your core business domain and help you reactively scale your systems to today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s concurrency demands.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

We will take a stroll through the concepts that you need to know like modules, components, services, routes, and guards to be able to create any Angular application.  Then we will make a quick stop at the Angular CLI to take a look around at all of the fantastic functionality and productivity it provide us.  Finally, we will finish our stroll through Angular looking at some real world code examples.  You will walk away with the knowledge and resources you need to immediately start coding your own Angular applications.   See you there to jump start your Angular development.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

A hard skill for a carpenter, for example, might be the ability to operate a power saw or use framing squares.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code.

The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Name": "Writing More Advanced Queries in T-SQL",
    "Abstract": "<p>For over 40 years, SQL has remained the gold standard for querying and manipulating data. While NoSQL databases are becoming more widely used, SQL remains a valuable skill in developers' toolbelts due to how prolific the language remains.<br /> <br /> However, despite its maturity, efficient and simple solutions are not always obvious in SQL. In this presentation, we'll be solving several scenarios based on real-world problems. Together we'll discuss common issues, why basic approaches fall short, and how applying more advanced SQL techniques provides a better alternative. While this presentation will focus specifically on T-SQL, the techniques we'll be covering are applicable to other variants of SQL as well. <br /> <br /> Topics covered:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Performance</strong> - Avoid row-by-agonizing-row (RBAR) approaches and use set-based solutions by leveraging a numbers table and by using window functions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Functionality</strong> - Navigate hierarchical data using recursive common table expressions (CTEs).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Avoid common concurrency pitfalls by strategically applying the appropriate isolation level within your query.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Applying these same techniques to other problems you may encounter in the future will lead to creative and elegant solutions.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

The story is actually even better - let’s unpack the promise of Xamarin.Forms. The reach goes beyond just mobile platforms of iOS, Android &amp; Windows – did you know your Xamarin.Forms apps could target MacOS, Smart Watches, Smart TVs, Refrigerators &amp; Hololens? And it’s not just futuristic devices or platforms, you could take Xamarin.Forms goodness back to WPF &amp; even Web! This isn’t utopia, but an absolute reality today.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.
