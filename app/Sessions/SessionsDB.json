    "Abstract": "Some of us may be completely new to the concepts and principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  Many others have been programming in an object oriented language such as Java or C# for years, or have taken courses in these topics, but still find it confusing.  \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will give hands on coding examples of the 4 key principles of object oriented programming, (1) encapsulation, (2) abstraction, (3) polymorphism and (4) inheritance.  We will explain their proper use, while motivating the discussion with practical real world examples and use cases.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "This session is about your career perspective as an engineer, especially when the path may take an “unexpected” turn from technical lead to first-time engineering manager. \r\n\r\nWe will explore the differences between managing and leading, review different management styles, and discuss their impact on both the manager and the team member. Finally, we will find out why you do not want to treat everyone equally. I will share my personal experiences going from being one of the team to actually managing it: the pitfalls of suddenly being responsible for the team, typical problems surfacing, and how to avoid common mistakes. \r\n\r\nAs part of the session, I would also like to share thoughts and considerations about which career path could be the right one for whom, and what the advantages and disadvantages are going one way or the other. \r\n\r\nThis is not a “You get it all from the expert”- session, but a session to share experiences and discuss how this fits to your career path.",

A hard skill for a carpenter, for example, might be the ability to operate a power saw or use framing squares.",

    "Abstract": "<p>Now that you have Kafka up and running how are you going to use it? Kafka doesn't care what it transfers; just that it gets delivered.</p>\r\n<p>You can blaze your own trail defining everything, but then everything is your and your user's responsibility. You can create the equivalent of a HATEOS message - which bloats your message and requires your clients to create a smart parser. In contrast you can create a minimalist message - which requires your clients to know everything about what your message and they'll have to make updates every-time you change the message.</p>\r\n<p>Enter Avro. Using Avro schemas allows you to define and share you message schema with all the information to validate your message ... without bloating your actual messages.</p>\r\n<p>In this talk we will be exploring what Avro is, what it isn't, and if it's worth your time. As a hardened Perl* programmer who lives by TIMTOWTDI, who abhors systems that get in the way by imposing their ideology, I'll share with you why I've adopted Avro when dealing with Kafka. * Code examples may include a Perl example, but will be primarily in Java.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

We&#39;ll see how each algorithm works, analyze its strengths and weaknesses, and determine when it is best used.  You&#39;ll leave with the knowledge you need to solve problems using these algorithms in your language of choice.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

You&#39;ll see how to incorporate these services into one sample: IoT Hub, Storage, Service Bus, Azure Stream Analytics, PowerBI, Logic Apps, and Office 365. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll give some examples of IoT, and then delve into IoT Hub. I&#39;ll show how to use the feature in IoT Hub that lets you configure routing rules and have the hub automagically send your messages every which way. We&#39;ll see how to route messages to a storage account. We&#39;ll see how to route messages to a Service Bus queue that will in turn use a Logic App to send you e-mails with the message content. You&#39;ll see the rest of the messages go to the default endpoint, to be picked up by Azure Stream Analytics and viewed in Power BI. We&#39;ll run a C# application that sends messages to the Hub and triggers the different kinds of routing, and see the messages flow through to the different destinations.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

But what if you need to catch Windows access violations, data misalignments, divisions by zero, illegal instructions, and a variety of floating point exceptions? You could use Microsoft&#39;s SEH, but it&#39;s not well integrated with standard C++ exception handling. In this session, you&#39;ll see how to catch Windows exceptions as standard C++ exceptions derived from the std::exception class. We&#39;ll use Visual Studio 2019 Community edition IDE and the Visual C++ compiler.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Why writing Clean Code makes us more efficient Over the lifetime of a product, maintaining the product is actually one - if not the most - expensive area(s) of the overall product costs. Writing clean code can significantly lower these costs. However, writing clean code also makes you more efficient during the initial development time and results in more stable code. \r\n\r\nYou will be presented design patterns and best practices which will make you write better and more easily maintainable code, seeing the code in a holistic way. You will learn how to apply them by using an existing implementation as the starting point of the presentation.\r\n\r\nFinally, patterns &amp; practices benefits are explained. This presentation is based on C#. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.",

    "Abstract": "Why writing Clean Code makes us more efficient? Over the lifetime of a product, maintaining the product is actually one - if not the most - expensive area(s) of the overall product costs. \r\n\r\nWe will dive into why decoupling is so crucial and what design patterns, best practices, and technologies are out there to do it right and want can go wrong. We start by reviewing the basics of Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) and different ways of achieving decoupling on class-level, using and exploring both: Best Practices, Design and Anti Patterns. Then we will move into Microservices, how these push decoupling to the next level and how to combine the different patterns for an extensible, supportable and maintainable code base. \r\n\r\nThis presentation requires knowledge and understanding of basics like DRY, SoC, SRP, SOLID etc. which are building the base for decoupled architecture. However, we will start at the basics of DI and will work towards intermediate scenarios for DI and Microservices depending on the participating group. \r\n\r\nThis presentation is based on C#. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.",

    "Abstract": "Today’s fast-moving software delivery environment emphasizes pushing value to production as quickly as possible. “Value to production” implicitly requires high quality—low quality is of little value to anyone! —which means teams need to focus on being able to specify, build, test, and deploy software effectively and quickly. Acceptance testing historically been manually intensive efforts run by a dedicated QA department, resulting in a slower pace of production releases.\r\n\r\nNo longer do we have to make acceptance a manual effort that requires a dedicated QA department.   With the release of Cypress, we have a new standard in front-end testing that allows every developer to create acceptance tests.  Come learn how you can create fast, easy, and reliable test for anything that runs in a browser regardless of the front-end framework used.\r\n\r\nYou will walk away ready to end the era of “Developers don’t write acceptance tests” and start writing acceptance tests for all of your projects.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Then suddenly one day after ramping up in your position you find yourself getting pulled into design reviews and cross-team meetings where you need to build consensus and influence others in ways that school didn&#39;t prepare you for. You may even find yourself avoiding or dreading these situations. \r\n\r\nThese conversations don&#39;t need to be painful however, especially when there can be major benefits to having them; all it takes is a bit of preparation and having the right mindset going in. Come learn some tips and tools for leading difficult discussions and constructively driving towards an end goal that results in a better product with less stress on your shoulders.\r\n\r\nNot a developer?

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Name": "Exploring Neural Word Embeddings with Python",
    "Abstract": "<p>Standing on the shoulders of giants, we don't have to design, create, and train a neural network, but instead, use one that already exists. We download a public domain fully trained neural network and modifying it slightly (to make it load faster during the session).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Python</strong></p>\r\n<p>I'm teaching a junior college&nbsp;Python course and usually show this at the end of a 16-week intro class. I.e., you don't need to be a Python expert to get something out of this session. Knowing a little Python will be helpful, but all demos easily translate into other languages, like Java for instance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\r\n<p>After the session you will have a general understanding of <em>\"Neural Word Embeddings\"</em>, understand what <em>\"cosine similarity\"</em> means and how to calculate it. I know, that may not sound all that exciting. But imagine you type in the question, <code>\"Men is to boys what woman is to\"</code> and your Python program answers with the word <code>\"girls\"</code>. Or you type <code>\"Men is to king, what woman is to\"</code> and your Python program answers with the word <code>\"queen\"</code>. But that is just the beginning, I will also show you an example that uses the same technique applied to a much more relevant topic, detecting bias in a text.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

    "Abstract": "There&#39;s a lot about modern networking that we all should un-learn. Showing off your knowledge and targeting the &quot;important&quot; connections is the wrong approach. If you genuinely want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional. That said, it&#39;s still hard to find people to talk to, and even harder to know to start up a conversation. I&#39;ll give you tips that will help you work through those issues and ultimately make you more comfortable in new spaces with new people. You&#39;ll come away from this presentation with advice you can put to use immediately.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

The session will not only examine the JavaScript syntax but also look at practical applications for learning. You’ll begin by learning the foundational concepts that make JavaScript—and any programming language, for that matter—function. You’ll then use actual code to develop simple learning applications and games. You’ll leave this workshop able to immediately apply JavaScript concepts to your daily work, and you’ll have the foundation you need to continue to deepen your skills with more advanced JavaScript topics on your own.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI. I am a public speaker and present internationally on a lot of different technology topics, a list of them are available at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/\">https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/</a>. &nbsp;I have been recognized as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jjg.me/MVPLink\">Microsoft MVP</a>&nbsp;in .NET (since 2009) and a Friends of Red Gate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.red-gate.com/community/friends-of-rg\">program</a>(since 2015).</p>\r\n<h3>Some of my notable achievements</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Former President and Vice President of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ineta.org/\">INETA</a>&nbsp;North America (2007-2015)</li>\r\n<li>Founder of the Southeast Valley .NET User Group (<a href=\"https://sevdnug.org/home.aspx\">SEVDNUG</a>) in Chandler, AZ (2007-2013)</li>\r\n<li>Currently serving on my the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/\">City of Chandler</a>'s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=287\">Parks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=732\">Recreation</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=268\">board</a>&nbsp;(since 2010)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/community/client-profile.aspx?cId=187651\">Telerik MVP</a>&nbsp;(2010 to 2012)</li>\r\n<li>Microsoft Visual Basic MVP (1996)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Open Source Projects (<a href=\"https://www.github.com/jguadagno\">https://www.github.com/jguadagno</a>)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://bingsharp.codeplex.com/\">BingSharp</a>: A wrapper around the Bing API in C#</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jguadagno/bootstrapThemeSwitcher\">bootstrapThemeSwitcher</a>: jquery plugin to dynamically load Bootstrap themes</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jguadagno/twbs-flickrCarousel\">twbs-flickrCarousel</a>: a bootstrap carousel to loop through Flickr pictures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Events I organize or participate in</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://desertcodecamp.com/\">Desert Code Camp</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://azgivecamp.org/\">AZGiveCamp</a></li>\r\n<li>Organizer for the 1st Time MVP event at the MVP Summit</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.josephguadagno.net/page/MVP-Summit-2011-C-MVP-2-MVP-Sessions.aspx\">MVP 2 MVP Sessions</a>&nbsp;at MVP Summit.</li>\r\n<li>Awesome bean pusher at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://geekgive.org/project/mvpsummit2012.aspx\">GeekGive</a>&nbsp;at the MVP Summit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Resume</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.josephguadagno.net/Resume/\">/resume/</a></p>",

    "Abstract": "When designing mobile user interfaces, a lot of developers and designers overlook the power of text. From formatting and presentation, to building editing experiences, text is an extremely important part of building good mobile applications. In this presentation, we will start by talking about fonts, typography, and dynamic type. We&#39;ll look at how to use standard and custom fonts and support iOS dynamic type settings to dynamically size your UIs based on the user&#39;s text size settings. We will then turn to attributed strings and text views and will look at how to present and interact with text in your UIs. We will end with a full-blown look at TextKit and how to build rich text editing experiences in your user interfaces including how to accomplish syntax highlighting, spell checking, and other features when building editing experiences. Please join us to learn about using text in your mobile applications. (This presentation is focused on iOS technologies.)",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "Abstract": "Is your organization adopting Kafka as their messaging bus but you’ve found that it will take too long to migrate your existing service-oriented architecture to a log-oriented architecture? Some of the biggest challenges in building a new stream processor can be implementing all the business logic again. It has become increasingly common for companies with high-throughput source streams and change-data-capture logs to want to build systems fast. At Ticketmaster, we have found a solution to the problem by leveraging the business logic in our existing services and calling them from our Java based KafkaStreams processor applications in an efficient manner. In this talk, we will examine the initial challenges we faced in our transition, then we will explore the solutions we built to address the use cases at Ticketmaster. The primary focus will address our workflow around calling services to bring stream processor applications to market fast. We will review our challenges and share tips for success.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

We will be using Logistic Regression, which is a very basic general purpose classification algorithm. It has been a popular choice for more than half a century. Even in our current era with the explosive advances in neural networks, Logistic Regression remains a mainstay for its simplicity and speed. Applying this very simple algorithm to the complex task of optical character recognition will help you see how approachable machine learning can be.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for the class, create an Amazon AWS account and go to Amazon SageMaker. Create a notebook instance with a name you will remember and instance type c5.xlarge. All the rest of the settings can be left as defaults. Once it is working, make sure you shut it down so the notebook instance status says &quot;Stopped&quot;. That way you will not be charged for it while you are not using it.

He spent a few years as a serial entrepreneur, and more time than he cares to admit in online advertising. Developing code on the Internet since 1993, he has watched it evolve from a radically open platform driven by passionate nerds to an engine for maximizing consumer spending to a device for mass public persuasion. Robert has used machine learning in advertising and social media projects; the power over people that he has seen at work, and put in place, has led him to deeply question our future and how we, computer scientists, can make it brighter.</p>",

    "Biography": "<p>Robert Bushman is a senior software engineer at Amazon and was formerly a consulting engineer at Apple. He spent a few years as a serial entrepreneur, and more time than he cares to admit in online advertising. Developing code on the Internet since 1993, he has watched it evolve from a radically open platform driven by passionate nerds to an engine for maximizing consumer spending to a device for mass public persuasion. Robert has used machine learning in advertising and social media projects; the power over people that he has seen at work, and put in place, has led him to deeply question our future and how we, computer scientists, can make it brighter.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS.

Talking to computers is great but we also need to be able to talk to humans and give an effective presentations if we want to be seen as the go to expert.  Join me in this interactive session to get the critical techniques I used to grow from 0 talks to giving 200+ talks at over 75 events around the world.    \r\n\r\nPublic speaking just like talking is a skill that can be learned with the right training and mentorship.  Being shy and introverted doesn&#39;t have to doom you to a life of only talking to computers even though it is really cool to talk to computers. \r\n\r\nYou will walk away inspired to share your knowledge and be seen as the go to expert.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development.

We will cover the basics of what syscalls are and their importance in systems programming and will show off a few small examples before diving into the main topic. This will include mapping syscall numbers to constants and looking at what the syscall itself requires for arguments and converting those C memory layouts into Go. We will go into a number of components in the standard library’s syscall package for converting strings to byte array pointers, etc. and working with the standard library’s unsafe package to access the system’s memory directly. Finally, we’ll put it all together and demonstrate the code with live examples. All code examples will be made available on Github.",

You&rsquo;ll discover how understanding and applying concepts like composition, contrast, negative space, and even typography can greatly improve content quality and usability. These concepts can be applied whether you&rsquo;re shooting video with an expensive professional camera or creating a simple web site for a community organization. You can improve your visual quality whether you have a professional studio or are just learning HTML. Visual literacy is a critical component of quality digital content, and after this session, you&rsquo;ll be able to identify weaknesses in your own content and fix them.</p>",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

Join me in looking at how the software industry has failed at fulfilling requirements and some of the ways it is believed to have caused those failures. Without understanding history, we&#39;re doomed to repeat it; but we&#39;ll also continue to look at details ways of addressing the problem.  We&#39;ll then round things out by moving past the subjective into the objective to detail some techniques all of us can use that truely help manage the symptoms causing the problems.",

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.

    "AboutText": "<h1>About Desert Code Camp</h1>\r\n<h2>What is Desert Code Camp?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Technology Conference name we follow these simple protocols:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>By and For the Developer Community</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Free</strong><br />\r\n<p>Desert Code Camps are free for attendees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Developed Material</strong><br />\r\n<p>The success of the Code Conferences is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to share or provide to attendees then the Technology Conference is not the place for you.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>No Fluff: Only Code</strong><br />\r\n<p>Code Conferences are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community Ownership</strong><br />\r\n<p>The most important element of the Technology Conference is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Never occur during work hours</strong><br />\r\n<p>We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Technology Conference is that they always occur on weekends.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Creator</h2>\r\n<h3>Joseph Guadagno</h3>\r\n<p>For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as a Team Leader at Quicken Loans, based in Detroit, MI.
